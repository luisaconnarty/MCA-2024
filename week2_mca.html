 <p>I have highlighted the errors that appeared in the transposition, but will detail their meaning and impact below</p>
 
 <p><u>ERRORS:</u><p>
 
 <ul>
	<li>Missing text at top (song title, artist, music arranger)</li>
	<li>Incorrect placement of and tempo marking above bar 1 </li>
	<li>Incorrect bar count</li>
	<li>Missing 'INTRO' direction</li>
	<li>Incorrect bar count</li>
	<li>Incorrect Bar line at beginning of bar 3</li>
	<li>Unnecessary inclusion of pedal marks on bars 13, 14 and 15</li>
	<li>Exclusion of lyrics</li>
	<li>missing all note in bars 1 and 2</li>
	<li>Elongated tie linking notes on bar 10-11</li>
	<li>Incorrect placement of notes on bars on the bottom line</li>
</ul>

 <p><u>IMPACTS:</u><p>
 
 <p>As discussed in our group laboratory on Tuesday, errors in incorrect OMR engine transcription can cause multiple issues.</p>
 <p>Overall, I would argue, my chosen piece was predominantly successful in transposing the music accurately. However, in saying that, the errors spotted still completely affect the sound of the music.</p>
 <p>Similar issues we encountered in the group and individual lab was the tempo either not showing up or being incorrect, this would result in the rhythm of the music being off, thus making it difficult to perform correctly.</p>
 <p>Similarly there were errors in the alignment of notes and bar-lines. This completely affects the readability of the score and would account for a completely different reading and sound.</p>
 
 <p>Additional impacts that may be experienced from inaccurate OMR scannings may include:</p>

<ul>
   <li>confusion with slurs, ties and ligatures in notation</li>
   <li>incorrect and missin accidentals altering sound of music</li>
   <li>Incorrect time signatures of keys, completely altering tonality and ability to perform a piece</li>
</ul>

<p>This is my edited and corrected version of the transcription, edited using MuseScore:</p>

<p>In editing this piece of music, I have increased the accuracy in readability of the music, in order to sound like the original, as intended.</p>
