    <p><b>CHOOSING CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE</b></p>
    
    </div>
    
<div id="task1body">
    <p>MY chosen licensing attribution is CC BY-NC 4.0, the terms of the license are as follows:</P>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Attribution - </b>You must give appropriate credit, provide link to the license, and indicate if changes were made; ensuring not to suggest the licenser endorsed your use.</li>
      <li><b>NonCommercial - </b>You may not use the material for commercial purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The creative commons license allows you thus to do the following things:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Share, copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format</li>
        <li>Adapt - Remix, transform and build upon material</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The CC BY-NC (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial) license allows creators to share their work freely as long as they are credited and itâ€™s not used for commercial purposes. As 'Hot To Go!' recieved its popularity through its manipulation and manifestation online, this license is ideal as it encourages public sharing, or personal projects while restricting profit-driven applications. Compared to more permissive licenses like CC BY or CC BY-SA, which allow for commercial use, CC BY-NC provides greater control over how the work is monetized. Therefore, the song can be used and shared,furthering its popularity, but ensures only approrprate sources are monetizing from the source. Unlike other licenses such as the CC BY-ND, which prohibits changes, CC BY-NC continues to allow others to adapt or remix the work, fostering creative innovation as long as it remains noncommercial. This balance makes CC BY-NC a popular choice for creators aiming to support open access with non-commercial protections. These factors I think are crucial in abiding to the new digital age in which music attains and gains popularity through its online relevance, hindering the ability to allow for sharing would go against this phenomenon and potentially depleat its relevance.</p>

<p><b>FORMATTING MY METADATA</b></p>

</div>

<div id="task2body">


    <p>Currently my Metadata is displayed in a large chunk of text at the top of my Verivo score with no punctuation, and no description of what means what. Thus, in terms of formatting, I would vertically list the the metadata, providing subtitles based on its category to ensure the clarity of the metadata's meaning, optimizing its relevance and use. E.g.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Song Title:</b> Hot To Go!</li>
  <li><b>Artist: Chappell Roan</b></li>
  <li><b>Album:</b>The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess</li>
</ul>
