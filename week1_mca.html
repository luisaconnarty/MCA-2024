  <h1>WEEK 1 TASK</h1>
  
  <h>TASK 2: IDENTIFY A THEME FOR YOUR DATASET</h>
  
  <p>For my dataset collection I am choosing the song 'Hot To GO!' released by Chappell Roan on the 11th August 2023, featuring on her debut studio album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess (2023). Main themes presented:</p>
  
  <ul>
  	<li> pop music </li>
  	<li> New Digital Age (social media) </li>
  </ul>
  	
  <p>Chappell Roan is a name and persona adopted by singer-songwrite Kayleigh Rose Amstutz. Roan is known for her theatrical, camp, and bold stage presence brought when performing her uniquw blend of pop, rock and indie sounds of music. My reasoning for choosing 'Hot To Go!' of all the songs on her discography is for its specific erruption of popularity online. This song was one of the first to bolster Roan's career through social media trends. The song has an accompanying dance Roan teaches her audiences in person at shows, and this dance is now deeply rooted in people's associations of the song even without attendance to the show through her music video and fans recodrings of concerts being shared online. I think it is very current in regards to the evolution of music data and will present new, or modern, manifestations of music data; exploring how the ever-progressing digital age is expanding the scope in defining music data, how it is collected, and further understood.</p>
  
  <h>TASK 3: CHALLENGES OF WORKING WITH MUSIC DATA</h>
  
  <p>General challenges:</p>

 <ul>
  	<li> licensing and copyright restrictions</li>
  	<li> varying qualities and formats of data </li>  
  	<li> technical complexities/ challenges in attaining or disseminating files</li>
  	<li> monetary restriction </li>  
  </ul>
  	
  <p>'Hot To Go!' challenges:</p>
  
   <ul>
  	<li> The cuiltural influence extends beyond traditional music metrics like sales and streaming numbers - hard to measure these data frameworks and engagements, so risk of inconsistant or inaccurate descriptive datas</li>
  	<li> There is a decentralised approach to interaction as much of the popularity is produced through User Generated Content (UGC) so Notated, acoustic and descriptive data used may not come from the direct source of the artist. </li>  
  	<li> with copyright and licensing protections in place, being a recently released pop song, access to notated and acoustic data will likely cost money</li> 
  </ul>
  
  <p>CURRENT MANIFESTATIONS OF DATA RELATING TO MY THEME</p>
  
  <p>DESCRIPTIVE DATA</p>
  <p>Descriptive data surrounding my chosen song can be found on multiple streaming platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, ITunes etc., providing information on length of song, title, lyrics, number of streams, date of release, liscensing, and so on. Additionally, the song has a Wikipedia page detailing similar information such as the songs producers and label. The Wikipedia page also offers background information into the writing process, composition and critical response of the song. Descriptive data can additionally include more descriptive metadata in the notated data including time scores, and keys.</p>
  
  <p>NOTATED DATA</p>
  <p>Notated formats of Data can be found on multiplke sheet music platforms online. For my project, I am purchasing an arrangement curated by ??, found and purchased on Musescore.com. However, there is a vast availability of notated data online with other websites including ultimate-guitar.com, as well as videos on social platforms such as Youtube and Tiktok displaying arrangements alongside a guided tutorial on how to play a cover of the song.</p>
   
   
  <p>ACOUSTIC DATA</p>
  <p>The original studio recording of 'Hot To Go!' is available on popular streaming platforms. Additionally, the music video for the song is available on YouTube. However, due to the songs popularity there are many live recordings of the song available online. Some of them are officially recorded and disseminated covers of the song by Chappell Roan, such as with her TinyDesk performance available om YouTube. However, there are also a number of recordings available to watch online of Chappell Roan's live performances of the song. There are also many TikTok videos made using the audio. The extent of acoustic data available of the song, mostly in, but not limited to, the format of live recordings, highlights the shift of the digital age and the impact of social media in the dissemination of acoustic data. For my project however, I will be purchasing the original studio recordnig of the song in <b> ??MP3 file format??</b></p>
